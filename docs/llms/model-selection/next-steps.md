In this session, we've moved beyond the hype of AI capabilities to the practical reality of business due diligence. You've learned that a model card is not just a technical document, but a critical tool for risk management, strategic planning, and competitive intelligence. We've established a robust framework—balancing **Performance, Cost, and Risk**—to guide your evaluation of any AI model and turn a complex technical analysis into a defensible business decision.

The core skill you've developed here is a form of healthy skepticism. It's the ability to ask critical questions, demand evidence, and read between the lines of a vendor's claims. This is one of the most valuable and durable skills you can possess as a leader in a world increasingly shaped by AI.

Now that you have the tools to critically evaluate a potential solution, our next step is to master the art of defining the problem. A perfectly chosen AI model is only as good as the business problem it is aimed at. In our next session, **"Problem Framing & Translating Business Needs to User Stories,"** we will focus on how to identify high-value business opportunities and translate them into clear, actionable requirements that can guide the development of a successful AI product. We've learned how to choose the right tool; now, we'll learn how to draw the right blueprint.
