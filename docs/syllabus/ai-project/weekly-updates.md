##  Weekly Team Sync & Reflection

### Objective ðŸŽ¯

The goal of this weekly assignment is to practice professional project management and communication. This report serves as your team's formal weekly sync, allowing you to reflect on your progress, plan your next steps, and identify any challenges.

This is also your primary channel for communicating your team's status to the instructor. It's a space to celebrate wins, analyze roadblocks, and ask for help. A thoughtful and consistent weekly sync is one of the strongest predictors of a successful final project.

### Due Date & Grading

  * **Due:** See Canvas.
  * **Grading:** This is a team-based, **Complete / Incomplete** assignment that contributes to your **5-point "Weekly Check-ins"** grade for the course.

-----

### Instructions

1.  **Create a `reports` Directory:** In your team's GitHub repository, create a new folder named `reports`. This is where all your weekly sync files will live.

2.  **Create a New Report File Each Week:** Each week, one team member should create a new markdown file inside the `reports` directory. Use the naming convention `week-XX-sync.md` (e.g., `week-02-sync.md`, `week-03-sync.md`, etc.).

3.  **Use the Template:** Copy and paste the markdown template below into your new file and fill it out collaboratively as a team. This meeting and report should take no more than 30-45 minutes if you are organized.

4.  **Commit and Push:** Once the report is complete, a designated team member will commit and push the file to your GitHub repository. Use a clear commit message (e.g., `docs: Add sync report for week 2`).

### What "Complete" Means

To receive a "Complete" for your weekly check-in, your submission must meet these markers:

  * âœ… **Submitted on time** in the correct folder with the correct file name.
  * âœ… **All sections of the template are filled out thoughtfully.** "Thoughtfully" means providing specific details, not just one-word answers.
  * âœ… **The "Challenges" section is constructive.** It not only states the problem but also describes what your team has already tried to do to solve it.
  * âœ… **The "Goals for Next Week" are specific and actionable.** A goal like "Work on the project" is not specific. A goal like "Implement the core Streamlit UI for user input (Issue \#5)" is specific.
