# The PoC Launch Kit & Team Reflection

## Objective üéØ

Your final task is not a traditional presentation. Instead, your team will create a professional **"launch kit"** for your proof-of-concept, designed to attract new users and convince stakeholders of your project's value. This is your chance to showcase your work in a format that mirrors a real-world product launch.

This will be followed by a **reflective team interview** with the instructor to synthesize your learning and critically examine your journey through the course.

## Due Date & Evaluation

* **Due:** See Canvas.
* **Evaluation:** This "launch kit" and the quality of your final application constitute the final assessment for your **45-point Group Project** grade. Your work will be evaluated using the main project rubric, particularly the criteria for **`Technical Execution`**, **`UX & Design`**, and **`Final Presentation & Demonstration`**.

## Components of the Final Deliverable

### The Video Pitch üé•

Your goal is to create a compelling, marketing-style video. This is not a technical deep-dive; it's a pitch designed to **woo potential users and sponsors**. It should be concise, professional, and persuasive. The recommended length is 3 to 5 minutes.

* **Content:** The video must clearly communicate the problem you're solving, demonstrate your application's core features in action, and articulate its unique value proposition.
* **AI-Powered Creativity:** You are explicitly encouraged to use AI in the creation of this video. This is a final opportunity to practice your "AI as a collaborator" skills for tasks like writing the script, creating a voiceover, generating background music, or even producing animated visuals.
* **Submission:** Upload your video to a platform like YouTube (as an "Unlisted" video) or Vimeo and place the link prominently at the top of your project's `README.md` file.


### The Quick-Start Guide üìñ

**`QUICK_START.md`** 

This is a practical, user-facing document. It should enable a brand-new user to understand your application's purpose and successfully complete the core tasks you identified in your initial project charter.

* **Content:** The guide should include a brief overview of the application and simple, step-by-step instructions for using 2-3 of its key features.
* **Audience:** Write for a non-technical user. Avoid jargon and focus on clarity. Your goal is to make a first-time user successful and confident.
* **Submission:** Create a new file named `QUICK_START.md` in the main directory of your team's GitHub repository.


### The Peer Review Process ü§ù

Giving and receiving professional, constructive feedback is a critical skill.

* **Process:** During finals week, each team will be assigned two other teams' "launch kits" to review. You will watch their video, read their quick-start guide, and use a provided rubric to offer feedback on the clarity, persuasiveness, and professionalism of their work.
* **Grading:** Thoughtful completion of the peer review process is a component of your individual participation grade.


### The Reflective Team Interview üß†

This is a **20-minute scheduled meeting** with the instructor during finals week. This is not a defense of your project, but a structured, collaborative conversation to reflect on your team's learning journey.

* **Purpose:** The goal is to foster self-reflection. We'll discuss your team's process, how your perspectives on AI have evolved, and whether AI ultimately helped or hindered your critical thinking and learning.
* **Preparation:** Your team will be provided with the interview questions in advance to help you prepare for a thoughtful discussion.

!!! hint "The Personal Journal üìì"

     The best interviews draw on specific, personal experiences. To prepare for this reflective conversation, I **strongly encourage** you to keep a simple, informal personal journal throughout the semester. This is not a graded assignment, but a tool for your own benefit.

     After a challenging "builder session" or an insightful "learner session," take just five minutes to jot down a few thoughts. A few sentences each week will provide you with a rich set of personal reflections to draw upon, leading to a much more insightful final conversation.

     **Some prompts to consider for your journal entries:**

     * What was the most confusing concept this week, and what finally made it "click"?
     * Describe a specific prompt that failed spectacularly. What did you learn from the failure?
     * Did using an AI tool today feel like a superpower or a crutch? Why?
     * What was a moment of success or friction within your team this week? How did you handle it?
     * What's one thing you believe about AI now that you didn't believe last week?
