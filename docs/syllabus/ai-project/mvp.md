# The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) & AI Collaboration Log

## Objective ðŸŽ¯

This deliverable assesses not only your working MVP code but also the **intentionality of your process**. You will demonstrate how your team is executing its governance plan and strategically collaborating with AI tools and prompts to build your application.


## Components of the MVP Deliverable

Your MVP submission consists of three parts, all of which must be present in your team's GitHub repository.

### The Functional MVP Code

* **Requirement:** Your core application code must be functional and demonstrate the primary user stories from your charter.

### The MVP Retrospective 

**`MVP_RETROSPECTIVE.md`**

* **Requirement:** Create a new file named `MVP_RETROSPECTIVE.md`. In it, reflect on your process by answering:
    1.  **Governance in Action:** How well did our team follow the collaboration protocol in our `GOVERNANCE.md`? What worked? What will we change?
    2.  **Challenges & Learnings:** What was the biggest technical or conceptual challenge we faced in this phase, and how did we overcome it?

### The AI Collaboration Log 

**`AI_COLLABORATION_LOG.md`**

* **Requirement:** Create a new file named `AI_COLLABORATION_LOG.md` to document your team's interaction with AI. This log must contain three sections:
    * **Section 1: Tool Manifest:** List the 2-3 primary AI tools your team used (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Gemini in AI Studio, Gemini CLI). For each tool, briefly describe *why* you used it and for *what types* of tasks.
    * **Section 2: Application Prompts:** Document the 2 most critical prompts that are used *inside* your application. For each, provide the full prompt text and a brief rationale for its design.
    * **Section 3: Process Prompts:** Provide 1-2 examples of high-impact prompts you used to help with the *process* of building your project (e.g., a prompt for brainstorming, summarizing research, or generating user stories).
