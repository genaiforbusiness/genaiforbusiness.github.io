# The Project Charter

## Objective ðŸŽ¯

The goal of this charter is to move beyond "vibe coding" and establish a professional foundation for your project. Before you write application code, your team must define your project as a **system of activities**. This involves creating a compelling business case, defining your product's features from a user's perspective, and establishing a governance framework for how your team will operate.

This charter is the strategic blueprint for your proof-of-concept. A well-thought-out charter is the first and most critical step in convincing a funding committee that your team is worth investing in.

## Due Date & Evaluation

* **Due:** See Canvas.
* **Evaluation:** This deliverable is a major component of your **Group Project** grade. It will be evaluated on the thoughtfulness and clarity of your planning, primarily under the "**Business Value & Problem Framing**" criterion in the main project rubric.


## Components of the Charter

Your charter consists of three distinct markdown files that must be completed and committed to your team's GitHub repository.

### The Business Case 

**`README.md` - The "Why"**

Your `README.md` is the front page of your project. It must clearly and concisely communicate the business purpose of your application. It should be written for a stakeholder who has five minutes to understand what you're doing and why it matters.

It must include:

* **Mission Statement:** A single, compelling sentence that summarizes your project's purpose.
* **The Problem:** A clear description of the specific, high-value business problem or user pain point you are solving.
* **Our Solution:** A high-level overview of how your AI application will address this problem.
* **Target User:** A brief description of the primary user you are building this for.

### The Product Features 

**`USER_STORIES.md` - The "What"**

This document translates your business idea into a prioritized list of product features, always from the perspective of your user.

It must include:

* **User Persona:** A detailed description of your primary target user. Include their role, goals, and frustrations related to the problem you're solving.
* **Epics & User Stories:** A list of major features (Epics) broken down into specific user needs (User Stories). All user stories must follow the format:
    > "As a **[type of user]**, I want to **[perform some action]** so that I can **[achieve some goal]**."

### The Operating Model 

**`GOVERNANCE.md` - The "How"**

This is the most important document for defining your team's process. It demonstrates that you have thought carefully about how to manage your project and collaborate effectively.

It must include:

* **Team Roles & Responsibilities:** Define the initial roles for your team members (e.g., Project Lead for this stage, Technical Lead, etc.). These roles can and should rotate in later stages.
* **Collaboration Protocol:** Detail your team's specific rules for using GitHub. How will you use Issues, Projects, and Discussions? What is your meeting schedule? How will you ensure all work is visible?
* **AI Usage Strategy:** This is a critical section. Answer the following:
       
    **Task Delegation:**

      *   Which project activities are suited for *ad-hoc assistance* from an AI (e.g., brainstorming, debugging a snippet)?
      *   Which activities are candidates for *systematic automation* using AI (e.g., generating unit tests, summarizing notes)?
    
    **Collaboration Protocol:**

      *   How will you strategically use AI as a collaborator?
      *   What is your policy for verifying and citing AI contributions?
    
* **Decision-Making Framework:** Briefly describe how your team will make decisions and resolve disagreements about features or technical approaches to ensure the project keeps moving forward.
