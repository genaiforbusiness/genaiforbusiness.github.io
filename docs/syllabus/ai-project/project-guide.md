# Project Guide: From Idea to Pitch

This guide is your roadmap for the semester-long project. It's broken down into four distinct stages, each with specific goals, tasks, and deliverables. Following this guide will help your team stay on track and build a successful proof-of-concept ready for its final pitch.


## :material-numeric-1-box: Ideation & Planning 

**Goal:** To define a valuable business problem and create a clear, actionable plan for your AI-powered solution.

This initial stage is critical. The quality of your planning here will directly impact the success of your project. You are acting as a product management team defining the "what" and "why" before you get to the "how."

**Key Tasks:**

* Brainstorm and select a specific business problem your chatbot will solve.
* Research the problem and define your target user. Create a **user persona**.
* Define your chatbot's personality and conversational tone.
* Break down the project's features into **epics and user stories**.
* Set up your GitHub repository, including your project board (Kanban).

**Deliverables (due at the end of Week 3):**

* A `TEAM_CHARTER.md` file in your repo outlining team roles, communication norms, and meeting schedules.
* An updated `README.md` file with a clear project mission statement and description.
* A `USER_STORIES.md` file containing your user persona and a prioritized list of user stories.
* Your GitHub Project board populated with issues (tasks) for Stage 2.

* *Article:* "An Introduction to Agile: Epics, User Stories, and Tasks"
* *Template:* "User Persona & User Story Template"
* *Guide:* "Setting Up Your GitHub Project for Success"


## :material-numeric-2-box: MVP Development 

**Goal:** To build the core, functional version of your chatbot—your Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

In this stage, your team transitions into a development role. The focus is on building the essential features defined in your user stories to create a working application.

**Key Tasks:**

* Set up and familiarize yourself with the **GitHub Codespaces** development environment.
* Use the provided scaffold code to build the basic application UI with Streamlit.
* Implement the primary conversation loop, connecting to the Gemini API.
* Engineer and test the initial prompts required to deliver the core functionality of your MVP.
* Continuously update the status of your Issues on the GitHub Project board.

**Deliverables (due at the end of Week 8):**

* A functional MVP application committed to your GitHub repository that can be run and tested.
* Clear, commented code for your core application logic.
* Weekly check-in reports demonstrating consistent progress against your project board.

**Supporting Resources:**

* *Guide:* "Getting Started with GitHub Codespaces"
* *Tutorial:* "Building Your First Web App with Streamlit"
* *Article:* "Anatomy of a Prompt: A Guide to Effective Prompt Engineering"
* *Code Snippet:* "Basic Python Script for Calling the Gemini API"


## :material-numeric-3-box: Refinement & Advanced Features 

**Goal:** To enhance your MVP with a key advanced capability and a polished user experience.

Now that you have a working MVP, you will add a high-impact feature—**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**—and refine your application based on initial testing and feedback.

**Key Tasks:**

* Integrate a RAG system that allows your chatbot to answer questions based on a specific document you provide (e.g., a PDF report, a text file).
* Refine the user interface and user experience (UX) to make the application more intuitive and professional.
* Begin evaluating your chatbot's performance. How reliable are its answers? Read and interpret the model card for the model you are using.
* Draft the project roadmap and begin outlining your final presentation.

**Deliverables (due at the end of Week 12):**

* Application enhanced with a functional RAG feature.
* A `ROADMAP.md` file in your repo outlining realistic future features and improvements.
* A draft of your final presentation slide deck.

**Supporting Resources:**

* *Article:* "What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Why Does It Matter?"
* *Tutorial:* "Implementing a Simple RAG System"
* *Guide:* "How to Read a Model Card and Why It's Important"
* *Article:* "Thinking About Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements"
* *Article:* "Principles of Good UX for AI Applications"


## :material-numeric-4-box: Finalizing & Pitching 

**Goal:** To polish your proof-of-concept, finalize your presentation, and deliver a compelling pitch to the "funding committee" (the class and instructor).

This is the final sprint. The focus shifts to quality assurance, storytelling, and professional delivery.

**Key Tasks:**

* Conduct final testing, identify and fix bugs, and add error handling.
* Polish the final UI and user instructions.
* Finalize your presentation deck, ensuring it tells a compelling story about the problem, your solution, and its value.
* Rehearse your live demonstration to ensure it runs smoothly.

**Deliverables (due in Week 14):**

* The final, polished version of your application in your GitHub repository.
* Your final presentation slide deck.
* A live, in-class presentation and demonstration of your project.
