# Peer Review Guide: The PoC Launch Kit

## Objective ðŸŽ¯

The goal of this peer review is to practice the essential professional skill of giving and receiving constructive feedback. As you prepare to enter the business world, you will constantly be asked to evaluate the work of your colleagues and, in turn, have your work evaluated by them.

This exercise provides a structured opportunity to:

1.  **Refine your critical eye** by analyzing how other teams approached the same challenge.
2.  **Learn from your peers** by seeing their unique solutions and communication styles.
3.  **Practice delivering feedback** that is specific, actionable, and professional.

## Timeline, Logistics, & Grading

* **Due Date:** See Canvas.
* **Process:** During the last week of class, each student will be randomly assigned two other teams' projects to review. Relevant links will be provided in Canvas.
* **Submission:** You will submit your feedback for each team via Canvas. The feedback will be shared with the reviewed team after grades are finalized.
* **Grading:** This is an individual task, but you are encouraged to discuss it as a team. Each student who submits two thoughtful reviews will receive **5 points** (on a Complete/Incomplete basis) toward their final course grade.


## The Review Framework

For each of the two teams you are assigned, you must review their "Launch Kit" (their video and their quick-start guide) and answer the following questions in the submission form.

**Instructions:** Use this rubric to evaluate each of the two "Launch Kits" assigned to you. The goal is to provide specific, constructive feedback that will help the other team understand what they did well and how they can improve. Fill out one of these for each team you review and submit it via the provided form.

The video's core message was immediately understandable. | **3 pts**<br/>The problem and solution were clear, but could have been explained more concisely or directly. | **1-2 pts**<br/>The purpose of the product was confusing or not well-defined in the video. | 
| **Persuasiveness**<br/>(4 pts) | **4 pts**<br/>The video was highly compelling and effectively demonstrated the product's value. It made a strong case for user adoption or sponsorship. | **3 pts**<br/>The video showed the product's value, but the "wow" factor or call to action could have been stronger. | **1-2 pts**<br/>The value proposition was weak or unclear. It was not persuasive. | 
| **Professionalism**<br/>(2 pts) | **2 pts**<br/>The video was polished, with clear audio, good pacing, and professional-looking visuals and editing. | **1 pt**<br/>The video was generally well-produced but had minor technical issues (e.g., inconsistent audio, awkward edits). | **0 pts**<br/>The video had significant technical issues that were distracting and made it hard to watch. |

## Rubric

**What "Complete" Means (5/5 Points)**

To receive a "Complete" grade for this assignment, your submission must meet these three criteria:

* âœ… **Timeliness:** You submitted reviews for **both** of your assigned teams by the deadline.
* âœ… **Completeness:** You answered **all** of the scaled and open-ended questions in the review framework for each team.
* âœ… **Thoughtfulness:** Your open-ended feedback is **constructive and specific**. A response like "it was good" is insufficient. Your feedback for each artifact must include at least one specific point of praise and one actionable suggestion for improvement.
