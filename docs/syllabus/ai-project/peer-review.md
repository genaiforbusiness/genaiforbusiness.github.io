# Peer Review Guide: The PoC Launch Kit

## Objective ðŸŽ¯

The goal of this peer review is to practice the essential professional skill of giving and receiving constructive feedback. As you prepare to enter the business world, you will constantly be asked to evaluate the work of your colleagues and, in turn, have your work evaluated by them.

This exercise provides a structured opportunity to:

1.  **Refine your critical eye** by analyzing how other teams approached the same challenge.
2.  **Learn from your peers** by seeing their unique solutions and communication styles.
3.  **Practice delivering feedback** that is specific, actionable, and professional.

## Timeline, Logistics, & Grading

* **Due Date:** See Canvas.
* **Process:** During the last week of class, each team will be randomly assigned two other teams' projects to review. Relevant links will be provided in Canvas.
* **Submission:** You will submit your feedback for each team via Canvas. The feedback will be shared with the reviewed team after grades are finalized.
* **Grading:** This is an individual task, but you are encouraged to discuss it as a team. Each student who submits two thoughtful reviews will receive **5 points** (on a Complete/Incomplete basis) toward their final course grade.


## The Review Framework

For each of the two teams you are assigned, you must review their "Launch Kit" (their video and their quick-start guide) and answer the following questions in the submission form.

### The Video Pitch 

* **Clarity (1-5 Scale):** How well did the video explain the business problem and their AI-powered solution?
    *(1 = Very confusing, 5 = Crystal clear)*
* **Persuasiveness (1-5 Scale):** How compelling was the video? Did it effectively "woo" you and make you want to try or sponsor the product?
    *(1 = Not at all persuasive, 5 = Extremely persuasive)*
* **Professionalism (1-5 Scale):** How polished and professional was the video's production (e.g., editing, audio quality, visuals)?
    *(1 = Unpolished, 5 = Very professional)*

* **Open-Ended Feedback:**
    1.  What was the **single strongest element** of their video pitch? (Be specific!)
    2.  What is **one specific, actionable suggestion** you have for how they could make their video even more effective?

### The Quick-Start Guide

* **Clarity (1-5 Scale):** How easy was the guide to understand for a first-time, non-technical user?
    *(1 = Very difficult to follow, 5 = Very easy to follow)*
* **Effectiveness (1-5 Scale):** After reading the guide, how confident are you that you could successfully use the application's key features?
    *(1 = Not at all confident, 5 = Very confident)*

* **Open-Ended Feedback:**
    1.  What was the **most helpful instruction or feature** in their guide?
    2.  What **one part of the guide was the most confusing** or could be simplified for a new user?


## Rubric

**What "Complete" Means (5/5 Points)**

To receive a "Complete" grade for this assignment, your submission must meet these three criteria:

* âœ… **Timeliness:** You submitted reviews for **both** of your assigned teams by the deadline.
* âœ… **Completeness:** You answered **all** of the scaled and open-ended questions in the review framework for each team.
* âœ… **Thoughtfulness:** Your open-ended feedback is **constructive and specific**. A response like "it was good" is insufficient. Your feedback for each artifact must include at least one specific point of praise and one actionable suggestion for improvement.
