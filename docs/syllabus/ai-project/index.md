# The AI Proof-of-Concept Challenge

## The Mission: From Idea to Investment

Welcome to the central experience of this course: the AI Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Challenge.

For the rest of this semester, your group will operate as a **cross-functional startup team** within a larger organization. Your mission is to identify a significant business challenge, design an innovative solution using Generative AI, and build a working prototype to prove its value.

The ultimate goal is to **secure approval and funding** from a committee of senior stakeholders (the instructor and your peers). Your final presentation will be a formal pitch where you not only demonstrate your working application but also make a compelling business case for why your project deserves investment and resources to be developed further.

This project is designed to be a realistic simulation of how AI products are conceived, built, and championed in a professional environment.


## The Process: A Four-Stage Journey

Your team will progress through a structured, four-stage development lifecycle that mirrors modern agile practices. Each stage has specific tasks, goals, and deliverables designed to keep you on track.

1.  **Stage 1: Ideation & Planning:** Define a valuable problem and create a clear, actionable plan.
2.  **Stage 2: MVP Development:** Build the core, functional version of your chatbot—your Minimum Viable Product.
3.  **Stage 3: Refinement & Advanced Features:** Enhance your MVP with a key advanced capability and a polished user experience.
4.  **Stage 4: Finalizing & Pitching:** Polish your PoC, finalize your presentation, and deliver a compelling pitch.

A detailed week-by-week roadmap with specific tasks and supporting resources is available in the **Project Roadmap** section of the course site.


## Evaluation: The Project Rubric

Your project is worth **45 points** of your final grade. It will be evaluated holistically based on the quality of your final prototype, the strategic thinking behind it, and the professionalism of your final pitch. The following rubric will be used for the formal evaluation.

| Criteria | Exemplary (A-Level) | Proficient (B-Level) | Developing (C-Level) | Unsatisfactory (D/F-Level) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Business Value & Problem Framing**<br/>**(10 Points)** | **10 Points**<br/>Project addresses a well-defined, significant business problem with a compelling value proposition. The solution is thoughtfully tailored to a clearly identified user. The project includes a **thoughtful and realistic roadmap for future features and improvements.** | **8 Points**<br/>Project addresses a relevant business problem and the value proposition is clear. The solution is appropriate for the target user, though the connection could be stronger. | **6 Points**<br/>A business problem is identified, but its significance is unclear, or the AI solution is a weak fit. The target user is defined but the solution is generic. | **0-5 Points**<br/>Project lacks a clear business purpose or solves a trivial problem. The value proposition is missing or confusing. |
| **Technical Execution & Functionality**<br/>**(15 Points)** | **15 Points**<br/>Application is fully functional, robust, and handles user errors gracefully. The implementation of advanced features (like RAG) is effective and well-integrated. Code is clean, well-organized, and commented. | **13 Points**<br/>Application is functional and meets all core requirements. Advanced features are implemented correctly. There may be minor bugs that don't impede core functionality. Code is organized. | **11 Points**<br/>Application's core functionality works but may be unreliable or have noticeable bugs. Advanced features are attempted but may be poorly implemented or inefficient. Code is disorganized. | **0-7 Points**<br/>Application is non-functional, crashes frequently, or fails to meet core requirements. Code is difficult to understand or run. |
| **User Experience (UX) & Design**<br/>**(10 Points)** | **10 Points**<br/>The user interface is intuitive, polished, and professional. The user journey is logical and seamless. The chatbot's persona and tone are consistent and well-suited to the application's purpose. | **8 Points**<br/>The user interface is clean and functional. The application is easy to use with minimal instruction. The chatbot's persona is defined but may have minor inconsistencies. | **6 Points**<br/>The user interface is functional but may be confusing or unappealing. The user may struggle with some tasks. The application lacks a clear design or persona. | **0-5 Points**<br/>The user interface is difficult to navigate or non-functional. The user experience is frustrating. No thought was given to design or persona. |
| **Final Presentation & Demonstration**<br/>**(10 Points)** | **10 Points**<br/>Presentation is clear, concise, and highly professional, effectively communicating the project's value. The live demo is smooth and showcases key strengths. The presentation concludes with a **compelling call to action, identifying key stakeholders and making a case for organizational adoption.** | **8 Points**<br/>Presentation is well-organized and clearly communicates the project's purpose and functionality. The live demo works as intended. The team answers questions effectively. | **6 Points**<br/>Presentation covers the required points but may be disorganized or unclear. The demo has noticeable technical issues or fails to highlight key features. | **0-5 Points**<br/>Presentation is unprofessional, poorly prepared, or fails to communicate the project's purpose. The demo is non-functional or not attempted. |


## Why This Rubric? Connecting Your Work to Real-World Success

The project rubric is more than a grading tool; it’s an "explicit nudge" designed to guide you toward building a product that could succeed outside the classroom. The success of a real-world AI project relies on far more than just its technical correctness. It requires a strategic vision, a deep understanding of its users, and a clear plan for adoption and growth.

Here’s how the rubric pushes you to develop these critical skills:

  * **It forces you to think like a strategist.** The **`Business Value`** criterion demands that you address a hard problem for the right user group. By requiring a **roadmap**, it pushes you to think about the project's **continual evolution** to keep up with changing user needs and technology.

  * **It makes you accountable for adoption.** The **`User Experience`** criterion directly measures how well you've designed a solution that minimizes disruption for the end-user. An intuitive and polished product is one that people will actually want to use.

  * **It prepares you to be an organizational champion.** The **`Final Presentation`** criterion is your opportunity to secure the financial, people, and data resources needed for your project to survive. By requiring you to make a **case for adoption** to key stakeholders, it trains you in the crucial skill of winning support for your ideas.

By focusing on these four areas, the rubric ensures you are not just learning to code an AI, but learning to build an AI *product*.
