# Grading & Evaluation

Our grading philosophy is designed to mirror a professional environment where success is measured by both individual skills and the quality of team collaboration. The evaluation structure is transparent, giving you clear targets and rewarding consistent effort, technical mastery, and strategic thinking.

## Overall Grade Distribution

Your final grade will be calculated out of a total of **100 points**, distributed across four key areas:

| Component | Points | Percentage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Cloud Skills Boost Labs](#cloud-skills-boost-labs) (Individual) | 40 points | 40% |
| [Group Project](ai-project/index.md) (Team) | 45 points | 45% |
| [Launch Kit - Peer Review](ai-project/peer-review.md) (Individual) | 5 points | 5% |
| [Active & Even Contribution](#individual-project-contribution) (Individual) | 10 points | 10% |
| **Total** | **100 points** | **100%** |


## Cloud Skills Boost Labs

This component measures your individual, hands-on mastery of core cloud and AI tools through official Google Cloud labs. This is a mastery-based grade; you choose the level you wish to achieve.

  * **Beginner Path Completion (C-Level):** Earns **28 out of 40 points**.
  * **Intermediate Path Completion (B-Level):** Earns **34 out of 40 points**.
  * **Advanced Path Completion (A-Level):** Earns the full **40 points**.

Completing these paths also earns you official Google Cloud badges that you can share on your LinkedIn profile to demonstrate your skills to potential employers.

## Individual Project Contribution 

This grade ensures individual accountability and rewards strong teamwork. It is assessed using your activity in the team's GitHub repository and a confidential peer evaluation.

| Criteria | Exemplary (A-Level) | Proficient (B-Level) | Needs Improvement (C/D-Level) | Unsatisfactory (F-Level) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Task Management & Completion**<br/>**(4 Points)** | **4 Points**<br/>Consistently completes all assigned GitHub Issues on time. Contributions are high-quality, well-documented, and clearly visible in the repository. | **3 Points**<br/>Completes most assigned Issues on time. Contributions are of good quality and visible in the repository. | **2 Points**<br/>Completes some assigned Issues, but may be frequently late or contributions are of low quality. | **0-1 Point**<br/>Fails to complete most assigned Issues. There is little to no evidence of work in the repository. |
| **Communication & Proactivity**<br/>**(3 Points)** | **3 Points**<br/>Frequently provides thoughtful comments, suggestions, and constructive feedback on the team's Issues. Proactively identifies new tasks and creates Issues for them. | **2 Points**<br/>Participates in discussions within Issues and offers feedback when asked. Communicates progress on assigned tasks. | **1 Point**<br/>Communication is minimal. Rarely participates in discussions or offers feedback. | **0 Points**<br/>No meaningful communication or proactive contributions are evident in the repository. |
| **Team Citizenship & Reliability**<br/>(Based on Peer Evaluation)<br/>**(3 Points)** | **3 Points**<br/>Peer evaluations consistently rate the student as a highly reliable, prepared, and supportive teammate who elevates the group's performance. | **2 Points**<br/>Peer evaluations indicate the student is a reliable and solid contributor who meets team expectations. | **1 Point**<br/>Peer evaluations suggest issues with reliability, preparation for meetings, or a pattern of passive contribution. | **0 Points**<br/>Peer evaluations consistently indicate a lack of participation, reliability, or respect for the team. |

**Peer Evaluation Process:** At the conclusion of the group project, you will be required to complete a confidential peer evaluation for each member of your team, including yourself. You will be asked to rate your teammates on a scale of 1-5 across several categories, such as reliability, quality of contributions, and communication, and provide a brief justification for your ratings.


## Grading Policies and Scale

  * **Late Submissions:** Late work is graded at the instructor's discretion. This is a project-based course that mimics a professional environment where deadlines matter. If you anticipate a delay, avoid surprises by communicating early and often.
  * **Extra Credit:** There are no explicit extra credit opportunities. The project is designed with ample room for you to demonstrate excellence and go above and beyond the baseline requirements.
  * **Final Grade Scale:** Your final point total will be converted to a letter grade based on the university's default grading scheme:

| Letter Grade | Range |
| :---: | :---: |
| **A** | 100% to 94% |
| **A-** | < 94% to 90% |
| **B+** | < 90% to 87% |
| **B** | < 87% to 84% |
| **B-** | < 84% to 80% |
| **C+** | < 80% to 77% |
| **C** | < 77% to 74% |
| **C-** | < 74% to 70% |
| **D+** | < 70% to 67% |
| **D** | < 67% to 64% |
| **D-** | < 64% to 61% |
| **F** | < 61% to 0% |
