# Course Policies

## **Attendance & Participation Policy**

**1. Policy Rationale**

Success in "Technical Foundations of Generative AI" requires consistent engagement and active participation. This course is designed as a hands-on, collaborative workshop. In-class sessions are not lectures but opportunities to build, troubleshoot, and learn from your peers. Your presence is therefore critical not only for your own learning but also for the learning of your project team and the class as a whole. This policy is intended to reflect the professional standard of accountability expected in the workplace.

**2. Attendance Requirement**

A minimum **attendance rate of 80%** is required to pass this course. Failure to meet this requirement will result in the final course grade being lowered by one full letter grade (e.g., from a B+ to a C+).

**3. Definition of an Absence**

Any instance of missing a scheduled class for any reason will be recorded as an absence. However, a distinction is made for documented, extenuating circumstances.

*   **Extenuating Circumstances (Excused):** These are serious, unavoidable events that prevent attendance and will *not* count toward the 80% threshold. They are limited to:
    *   Documented medical emergencies or significant illness.
    *   A death in the immediate family.
    *   University-sanctioned activities (e.g., athletic competitions, academic conferences) with prior official notification.
    *   Recognized religious observances.

*   **Non-Extenuating Circumstances (Unexcused):** These absences, even when communicated in advance, **will be counted as an absence** and apply toward the 80% threshold. Examples include, but are not limited to:
    *   Job interviews or work-related commitments.
    *   Personal travel or family vacations.
    *   Appointments that could be scheduled outside of class time.
    *   Minor illnesses without medical documentation.

**4. Notification Procedure**

*   For any absence, students are expected to notify the instructor via email **prior to the start of class** as a matter of professional courtesy.
*   To have an absence classified as an "Extenuating Circumstance," official documentation (e.g., a note from a medical professional, a university notice) must be provided to the instructor within one week of the absence.

**5. Tardiness**

Arriving more than 10 minutes late or leaving more than 10 minutes before the class concludes is disruptive to the learning environment. Every **three instances** of tardiness or early departure will be recorded as **one unexcused absence**.

College/Graduate school can be an exciting and challenging time for students. Taking time to maintain your well-being

### Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion
The University of Pittsburgh does not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation based on 
disability, race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, genetic information, marital status, familial status, 
sex, age, sexual orientation, veteran status or gender identity or other factors as stated in the University’s Title IX

I ask that everyone in the class strive to help ensure that other members of this class can learn in a supportive

and Inclusion. If you wish to maintain complete confidentiality, you may also contact the University Counseling Center

Any student suspected of violating this obligation for any reason during the semester will be required to participate 
in the procedural process, initiated at the instructor level, as outlined in the University Guidelines on Academic 
Integrity. This may include, but is not limited to, the confiscation of the examination of any individual suspected of 
violating University Policy. Furthermore, no student may bring any unauthorized materials to an exam, including 
dictionaries and programmable calculators.
