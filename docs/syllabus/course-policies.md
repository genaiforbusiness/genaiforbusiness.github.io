# Course Policies

## Your Well-being Matters
College/Graduate school can be an exciting and challenging time for students. Taking time to maintain your well-being 
and seek appropriate support can help you achieve your goals and lead a fulfilling life. It can be helpful to remember 
that we all benefit from assistance and guidance at times, and there are many resources available to support your 
well-being while you are at Pitt. You are encouraged to visit [Thrive@Pitt](https://www.thrive.pitt.edu/) to learn more 
about well-being and the many campus resources available to help you thrive.

If you or anyone you know experiences overwhelming academic stress, persistent difficult feelings and/or challenging 
life events, you are strongly encouraged to seek support. In addition to reaching out to friends and loved ones, 
consider connecting with a faculty member you trust for assistance connecting to helpful resources.

The [University Counseling Center](http://www.counseling.pitt.edu/) is also here for you. You can call 412-648-7930 
at any time to connect with a clinician. If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal, please call the University 
Counseling Center at any time at 412-648-7930. You can also contact Resolve Crisis Network at 888-796-8226. 
If the situation is life threatening, call Pitt Police at 412-624-2121 or dial 911.

## Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion
The University of Pittsburgh does not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation based on 
disability, race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, genetic information, marital status, familial status, 
sex, age, sexual orientation, veteran status or gender identity or other factors as stated in the University’s Title IX 
policy. The University is committed to taking prompt action to end a hostile environment that interferes with the 
University’s mission. For more information about policies, procedures, and practices, visit the 
[Civil Rights & Title IX Compliance web page](https://www.diversity.pitt.edu/civil-rights-title-ix).

I ask that everyone in the class strive to help ensure that other members of this class can learn in a supportive 
and respectful environment. If there are instances of the aforementioned issues, please contact the Title IX Coordinator
, by calling 412-648-7860, or e-mailing [titleixcoordinator@pitt.edu](mailto:titleixcoordinator@pitt.edu). Reports can 
also be [filed online](https://www.diversity.pitt.edu/civil-rights-title-ix/how-make-report). You may also choose to 
report this to a faculty/staff member; they are required to communicate this to the University’s Office of Diversity 
and Inclusion. If you wish to maintain complete confidentiality, you may also contact the University Counseling Center 
(412-648-7930).

## Disability Services
If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both 
your instructor and [Disability Resources and Services](https://www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/drs/) (DRS), 
140 William Pitt Union, (412) 648-7890, [drsrecep@pitt.edu](mailto:drsrecep@pitt.edu), 
(412) 228-5347 for P3 ASL users, as early as possible in the term. DRS will verify your disability and determine 
reasonable accommodations for this course.

## Academic Integrity
Students in this course will be expected to comply with the 
[University of Pittsburgh’s Policy on Academic Integrity](https://www.provost.pitt.edu/info/ai1.html). 
Any student suspected of violating this obligation for any reason during the semester will be required to participate 
in the procedural process, initiated at the instructor level, as outlined in the University Guidelines on Academic 
Integrity. This may include, but is not limited to, the confiscation of the examination of any individual suspected of 
violating University Policy. Furthermore, no student may bring any unauthorized materials to an exam, including 
dictionaries and programmable calculators.

[Academic Integrity Guide](http://pitt.libguides.com/academicintegrity/)
