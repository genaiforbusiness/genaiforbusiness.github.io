## Learning by Building

My core belief is that you learn a practical skill like Generative AI not by listening to lectures, but by **building things**. You wouldn't learn to swim by reading a book about hydrodynamics; you learn by getting in the water. This course is our swimming pool. My role is less that of a traditional lecturer and more of a **guide and a coach**. I am here to provide the initial map, point you to the right tools, and help you navigate the inevitable challenges you'll encounter while building your project.

### What to Expect

1.  **Embrace Productive Discomfort:** This field is changing weekly. No one has all the answers, and that's okay. We will treat this ambiguity not as a problem, but as an opportunity. A key skill you will develop is learning how to find solutions in a fast-moving environment where the documentation is always slightly out of date. This is the reality of working in technology today, and learning to be comfortable with being "uncomfortable" is a superpower.

2.  **We are a Development Team:** Think of our class not as a lecture hall, but as a startup's project room. I am the lead, and you are the development teams. Our class time will focus on project work, solving problems, and sharing what we've learned. Your success—and a significant part of your grade—will come from collaborating effectively with your team, managing your project professionally, and delivering a functional product.

3.  **The "Why" Before the "What":** We will always start with a real-world problem or a business case. Instead of me telling you about a concept like "Retrieval-Augmented Generation," I will present you with a challenge: "Our chatbot doesn't know anything about our company's latest products. How can we teach it?" This problem-first approach ensures that every technical concept you learn is immediately grounded in a practical application.

### How to Succeed in This Course

* **Be Curious and Proactive:** When you encounter a problem, your first step should be to try and solve it. Tinker with the code, consult the documentation, and collaborate with your team. My role is to help you when you're truly stuck, not to provide immediate answers.
* **Communicate Professionally:** Use the tools we provide (like GitHub Issues) to document your work, ask questions, and track your progress. Clear communication is the foundation of successful teamwork.
* **Be a Great Teammate:** Your project's success depends on the collective effort of your group. Show up for your team, contribute your share, and be open to different ideas. We will have mechanisms in place to ensure individual contributions are recognized.

Ultimately, my goal is for you to leave this course with more than just knowledge. I want you to leave with the confidence, skills, and experience to build and lead AI projects in your future career. I look forward to building alongside you this semester.
