# Schedule


## Course Schedule

This schedule is designed around a weekly rhythm. The first session of the week is typically a **Learner Session** 🧠, where we introduce and discuss new concepts. The second session is a **Builder Session** 🛠️, where you'll apply those concepts directly to your team project in a hands-on workshop format.
